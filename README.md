# philosophers
This project tackles the [dining philosophers problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem) using multithreading and mutexes. 

## Implementation
To tackle this problem, we utilize threads and mutexes. Each philosopher is represented as a separate thread, and mutexes are used to synchronize access to shared resources (forks).
